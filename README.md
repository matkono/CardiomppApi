## Problem diagnosis

Peripartum Cardiomyopathy (CMPP) is a disease associated with pregnancy that usually occurs in the peripartum period and can be fatal.
We can mention multiparity, age over 30, multiple pregnancy, obesity, low economic income, black ethnicity, hypertension and toxemia as risk factors.
In addition to the fact that it is a neglected disease due to lack of knowledge, exponentially aggravating the scenario.
The range of incidence fluctuates according to demographic data of the population, the rigor of the definition and the underreporting resulting from a lack of awareness or misdiagnosis.
In the city of Niter√≥i, a municipality in the state of Rio de Janeiro, according to DATASUS, there is an incidence of 439.16 cases per 100,000 pregnancies. About 4 times more than in the United States, where the average is 1 in 1000 to 4000.
In parallel to this, according to the analysis made by Hootsuite, in 2018, it was estimated that 194 billion downloads of mobile applications aimed at the healthcare area were carried out worldwide.
This is because, with the need to obtain information quickly, investment in technologies and applications to improve the quality of mobile interaction has grown exponentially.
Thus, we can see that more and more technology is used as an aid tool in the health area.
With this, the Institutes of Computing and Medicine, of the Universidade Federal Fluminense, entered into a partnership in order to develop a mobile application to aid decision making regarding the scenario of Periparto Cardiomyopathy, from a decision tree.
